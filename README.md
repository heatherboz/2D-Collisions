# 2D-Collisions
## Description 
This program simulates real 2D Collision, using the physics of inelastic collisions. The size of the balls is directly proportional to their mass, 
and they interact with other balls just as they would in reality. A side panel is present that allows you to view the mass, speed, 
velocity, kinetic energy, and momentum of each ball in real time. The user is able to add balls of whatever size anywhere to the screen during
the simulation, provided there is enough space.
